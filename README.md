This is the repository for the submission to the Week 4 project of the Coursera course Getting And Cleaning Data from the Johns Hopkins University.

**Downloading the dataset**
In order to download the dataset, the get_dataset.R script must be run first. It will handle both the download and the extraction of the dataset. The name of the dataset file can be changed at the start of the script. The default name is "dataset.zip".

**Tidying the data**
The cleaning and tidying of the data is done by the script run_analysis.R. It first merges all the original data, before calculating the average of each variable for a given activity and subject. This script outputs a .txt file with the clean data. The default name for this output file is "tidy_data.txt" but it can be changed at the start of the script.

**Tidy dataset**
The tidy dataset created by run_analysis.R gathers the averages of each variable for a given activity and subject.

The variables within are described in codebook.md.
